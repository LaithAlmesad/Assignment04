In order to run this app, after cloning the repository run the application and through XAMPP control panel create a data base called "task-manager"
When running the app, to gain access to the webpage itself go to http://localhost:8080/goals/all, through this you should be able to see your list and create goals
to gain access to the tasks, all you have to do it go to http://localhost:8080/tasks/goals/{goal_ID here} to edit the task of a specific goal
(This part of the assignment was a little buggy with the webpage, all the information is saved on the database, but in order to navigate we need to use webpages for this part)
http://localhost:8080/tasks/edit/{task_id}- this will allow you to edit a task
http://localhost:8080/tasks/{task_id}- this will allow you to see the details of a task
